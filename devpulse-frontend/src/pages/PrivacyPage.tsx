          DevPulse helps teams decide which pull requests need a careful review. To do that it needs a small amount
          of information from GitHub. This page explains exactly what we collect, why, and what we never touch.

        <p>When you sign in with GitHub, we store:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>
              <strong>Your GitHub profile basics</strong> — your GitHub user ID, username, display name and avatar URL.
              We ask GitHub only for the <code className="font-mono text-[13px] text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300">read:user</code> scope.
            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>
              <strong>Your workspace</strong> — the organization DevPulse creates for you and your role in it.
            </span>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you connect repositories through the DevPulse GitHub App, we store:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>
              <strong>Repository details</strong> — owner, name, whether it's private, and the installation it belongs to.
            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>
              <strong>Pull request metadata</strong> — title, description, author username, branch names, commit IDs,
              state, timestamps, and how many lines and files changed.
            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>
              <strong>Risk assessments</strong> — the score, the rules that fired, and the <em>paths</em> of the files
              that triggered them (for example <code className="font-mono text-[13px] text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300">src/auth/login.js</code>).
            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>
              <strong>Webhook events</strong> — the notifications GitHub sends when a pull request changes, which contain
              pull request and repository metadata.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>
              <strong>Your source code.</strong> We never store file contents or diffs. To score a pull request we
              ask GitHub for its list of changed files; GitHub's reply includes short diff snippets, which we discard
              immediately — only the file paths are kept.
            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>
              <strong>Your GitHub password or access token.</strong> Sign-in happens on GitHub. The token GitHub gives
              us is used once to read your profile and then discarded.

          <li>
            <span>
              <strong>Repositories you didn't choose.</strong> The GitHub App only sees repositories you explicitly
              grant it, and you can change that selection at any time.

          to keep you signed in. It's HTTP-only (scripts can't read it), sent only over HTTPS, and expires after 7
          days or when you sign out. There are no other cookies.
