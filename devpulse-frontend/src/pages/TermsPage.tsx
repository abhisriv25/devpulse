          Scores come from automated rules and can miss real problems or flag safe changes. DevPulse is provided
          <strong> "as is", without warranties</strong>, and the creators aren't liable for decisions made using it.

          You can stop using DevPulse at any time by uninstalling the GitHub App. We may update these terms as the
